#!/usr/bin/env bash
# The verification gate for this repository on Linux: every check AGENTS.md requires, plus the three
# instruments and the Rust suite with its process-level cases *required* rather than skipped.
#
# **Why this file exists rather than a list of commands in a document.** The gate used to be run by
# hand, and the sequence had two properties nobody could see: a step's failure did not stop the next
# one, and the script's own exit code was the last command's — so a red `cargo test` followed by a
# successful `ls` reported success. It exited 0 on a run whose suite had failed, which is the same
# defect this repository keeps finding in its tools (a reading that does not mean what it says), and
# it is worse here than anywhere else: everything else is verified *by* this.
#
# So: every step runs even after one fails (a summary of all of them is worth more than the first
# failure), each step's status is recorded, and the exit code is 1 if ANY step failed. `--only` runs a
# subset, which is also how the failure propagation above is tested.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/gate.sh                  # everything except e2e
#   bash scripts/gate.sh --with-e2e       # …and the Playwright suite (needs a browser, ~2–4 minutes)
#   bash scripts/gate.sh --only verify,fmt  # a subset; the summary still says which steps ran
#
# Steps, in the order they run:
#   verify      `pnpm verify` — typecheck, lint (with its warning ceiling), tests, perf,
#               the renderer build and the export-CSS check, in CI's order
#   fmt         `cargo fmt --all --check`
#   clippy      `cargo clippy --all-targets --locked`, then its warning ceiling (`CLIPPY_CEILING`
#               below; the warnings are read from the step's own log)
#   instruments `check-reachability.py`, `check-dead-exports.py`, `check-channels.py`
#   scripts     the suites that test this repository's own shell scripts
#   harness     the WebKit measurement harness's own `node:test` files
#   build       `tauri build --no-bundle` — the artefact the process-level cases below drive
#   rust        the whole suite with `NEKOWITE_REQUIRE_PROCESS_TESTS=1`, so a case that cannot run
#               fails instead of skipping (finding T1)
#   e2e         the Playwright suite, only with `--with-e2e`
