  // constant rather than the literal: the pet names its own section once, in
  // `pet-contracts/config.ts`, and a literal here would be a second spelling of one decision that
  // only fails where nobody looks — a right-click whose settings row is not the row it opened.
  // The sub-pages are *not* union members: they are §5.1's second level, behind
  // `DesktopPetSettingsSection`, so a rail row for each of the seven would be a different control.

/**

 * page, and the panel lands there instead. `page` is optional because only the pet's section has a
 * second level — every other section is one page — and the pet's own container is what falls back
 * to a page this build can actually render (`DesktopPetSettings.vue`). A caller that names no page
 * is asking for the section, not for a page called `undefined`.
