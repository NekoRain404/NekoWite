/**
 * The settings dialog: the shell, the navigation rail and one section at a time.
 *
 * Orchestration only (§13.3). Each section renders itself and reads its own
 * state through `composables/*`, so this file holds no store reads at all
 * (§10.2) — what is left is the modal chrome and which section is visible.
 *
 * **This dialog is not teleported, and that is a decision rather than an
 * omission.** It used to be (`<Teleport to="body">`, carried over from the
 * 1508-line panel this file was split out of), and the cost was the whole
 * dialog, not a corner of it: `.shell` is the element that carries the user's
 * appearance — `data-theme`, `data-color-scheme`, `data-accent`,
 * `data-contrast`, `data-locale` and the seven inline `--app-*` properties
 * `AppShell.vue` writes — and a child of `body` is outside all of it. Measured
 * in Chromium with the dark `forest` scheme and a serif UI font chosen through
 * these very controls, the dialog drew `#fffefb` on `#292a27` in `system-ui`
 * with `--app-body-size: 15px`, while the shell beside it drew `#243020` on
 * `#e8f3e2` in the chosen serif at `17px`. A user picked a theme, a scheme and
 * a font by looking at a dialog that could show none of them.
 *
 * Nothing needs the teleport. The overlay is `position: fixed` — out of the
 * layout's flow wherever it is rendered — so what it needed was to be inside the
 * scope, and `AppDialogs.vue` already renders this component inside `.shell`,
 * beside the four dialogs that were never teleported and have always drawn the
 * user's palette. Anything that moves this element out of `.shell` again gives
 * every control in it a token instead of the setting it is there to show;
 * `e2e/settings-dialog-scope.spec.ts` measures the pair.
 *
 * The export section used to be the exception: the panel held its writable
 * computeds and forwarded its two events, because §10.3-C sends the export
 * *commands* out of the section. They still are — `useExportSettings` owns
 * them — but the section now reads that composable itself, the way the AI
 * prompt shelf does. Forwarding six models and five handlers through a shell
 * that owns none of them was the panel doing the section's job.

               leaving is still arriving's equal, not a thing to be waited on.
               Vue's `<Transition>` default mode runs the two together, which
               is what the earlier "switch categories quickly and it must go
               straight to the latest state, not queue" asks for — `out-in`
               would blank the destination for the whole exit. The leaving
               page is taken out of flow so the scroll container never briefly
               holds both (see the stylesheet), which is the same reason its
               number is the same as the panels': the box has to stay put even
               while the thing inside it changes.
               Every section's root is a single element, so the transition
               classes land on it and nothing about the markup or the focus
               watch changes.
               The two hooks are the other half of taking the leaver out of
               flow: an out-of-flow page that is still in the tab order is
               still a place the user can be, and measured it stayed *findable*
               too — 60ms after a switch the previous section still matched 15
               controls that now sit under the new one. See surface-leave.ts,
               and `.page-leave-active` below for the pointer. -->
