/**
 * V13 — the registry client: what it does with each answer the backend can give.
 *
 * The wire literals below are the *shape* `R/src/commands/agent_registry.rs` serializes, written out
 * by hand rather than derived from the Rust types, because the coupling this file guards is between
 * two processes: a renamed JSON field keeps every Rust assertion green and would leave the page with
 * a blank row. The litmus is `the_wire_shape_the_backend_sends` — if the Rust side changes a key,
 * that case must change with it, and review is what catches the pair drifting.
 *
 * Three properties, one per group:
 *
 *  - **A refusal is data, and a rejection is not.** `null` is an accepted change; a refusal comes
 *    back as itself, arm for arm, with the facts the page's sentences have slots for; and anything
 *    this file cannot read is a *rejection*, which is the page's "the backend could not be reached"
 *    answer with a retry — never a silent empty list.
 *  - **Nothing is cast.** Every field the section reads is narrowed, so a value that is not what its
 *    name says (a number where a string belongs, an arm this build does not know) never reaches the
 *    page as a blank line.
 *  - **A message never quotes a value.** The malformed-answer errors name the field, not what was in
 *    it: the value is unknown by construction — that is why the check failed — and one of these
 *    fields is where a credential would be if the backend ever stopped masking.

/**
 * One entry, spelled the way the Rust side serializes it: `RegistryEntry` in

 *
 * A function rather than a constant, so a case that changes one field gets the rest of the shape
 * as the backend's own — and so the cases below can reach a field that is *inside* the entry
 * without an indexed read of an `unknown`. Reaching it through the readout's own JSON is what
 * those cases used to do, and what made them spread a value the checker can only call `unknown`.
