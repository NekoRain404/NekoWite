/**

 *
 * The component that renders the panel is wiring and markup; this is the half
 * that has to be right, and it is the half that cannot be reasoned about by
 * looking at a mounted component:
 *
 * - **Every write is ONE transaction** (§ the attrs module in editor-core), so a
 *   field edit and a locked resize are each a single undo step.
 * - **A write is not allowed to close the panel it came from.** `setNodeMarkup`
 *   on a leaf is a same-size replace AT the NodeSelection anchor, and
 *   ProseMirror maps the anchor boundary of such a replace as "deleted" — the
 *   selection is remapped to a text caret, the image-selection plugin emits
 *   null, and the panel would shut itself after the first character typed. The
 *   repair is `reselectImage` after every write.
 * - **Populating the form never writes.** `syncing` is the guard the watchers
 *   honour; without it the initial population would re-patch the node with the
 *   values it just read and burn an undo step opening the panel.
