//! What one launch *is*: the program, its arguments, the credential-bearing environment, and the CA
//! bundle this app injects into it.
//!
//! A module of its own rather than a section of [`super`], and the split is by what makes each part
//! change. This moves when the *contents* of a launch do: which program a registration pins (T14's
//! packaging decision), which variables carry a credential and how one is allowed to reach the
//! child, or the certificate policy of P0 §2.4. Nothing here reads a pipe, sends a signal or looks
//! at a process table, so none of the reasons `super`'s other children change can reach it.
//!
//! The one thing to keep in mind while reading it: [`EngineLaunch::env`] is a `Vec<(String, Secret)>`
//! rather than a `Vec<(String, String)>`, and that is a fix rather than a style — the field's own
//! doc carries what T3a found and what T12 refused to do about it.
