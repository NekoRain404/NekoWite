//! §3.4's first negotiation: the handshake, once per incarnation and before any session.
//!
//! **Why it is a file of its own.** It was a section of [`super`], which passed the 600-line budget
//! `docs/dev.md:286` puts on a business source file, and the criterion that section states is the
//! number of reasons a file changes rather than its length. This module moves when the *negotiation
//! rule* moves: what ACP requires to be first on a connection, what this host keeps from the answer,
//! or who may read it. The parent moves when the host's own table of sessions does — and this is
//! deliberately not per session: one process answers the handshake once and every session on that
//! process shares the answer.
//!
//! The bound on the call stays with the other two bounds in [`super`], because the three are read
//! against each other (`LOAD_BOUND`'s own doc argues from `CONTROL_BOUND`).
